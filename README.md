### Premise

In this arcade-adventure game, you will play as the space-potato-farmer Jeb. These space potatoes are genetically modified to be packed with nutrients, among other things! They are the life source of Jeb's colony, and they must be protected at all costs.

Unfortunately, an experimental genetic mutation has gone horrible wrong, and evil starch have started attacking the colony! Using your potatoes as weapons, you'll navigate a 2.5D world and defend your food, and your colony!
